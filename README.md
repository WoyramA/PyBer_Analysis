## Overview
This PyBer Analysis summarizes how Pandas were used in analyzing Ride-Share data for cities to calculate the number of rides, drivers and total fares  by Omar and I for out boss V. Isualize.

## Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
 Deliverable 1 shows how Omar and I used ride -sharing data to analyze the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for each city type from two DataFrames: City_Data and Ride_Data.
Both DataFrames were merged to a new summary dataframe after being cleaned and columns formatted. The average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each city type were also presented by Omar and I for our boss, V. Isualize.

## Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
Deliverable 2 shows how Omar and I deployed our skills in Pandas to present a multiple-line graph of the total fares for each week by city type.	

## Results
The results Omar and I drew from the data analyzed using our Pandas skills are listed below:
### 
Urban cities reported the largest total rides, followed by the suburban cities with the rural cities having the lowest number of total rides.

### 
Rural drivers recorded the least total number of drivers, being 1/6 the total number of Suburban drivers while Urban drivers were approximately 5 times the total number of suburban drivers.
### 
The total amount of fares in the urban cities was double the average fare from the suburban cities, which in turn were 4.5 times how much the average fare per ride made in the rural cities.
### 
Comparatively, the average fare per driver was rather highest among the drivers in rural cites as compared to drivers in the other cities. The Suburban drivers had double the average fare drivers in the urban cities received per driver.

## Summary
Mr V. Isualize, it was noted that between January and April, 2019, the results show that the fares by week in increased in late February in Rural, Suburban and Urban cities. It could therefore be recommended that Late February is a good month to optimize a ride-share business.
The results also suggest that fares are generally higher in Urban cities, followed by suburban cities and lowest in the rural areas.
The average fare per ride however between Rural and suburban cities did not vary by much and similarly between the suburban and urban cities as well, the average fare per ride varied with almost the same difference.
